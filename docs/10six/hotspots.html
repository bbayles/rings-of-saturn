<p>You will notice that hotspots move out from under your Wells. This is part of the
volatile nature of Transium, and you will have to learn to keep an eye on your Transium
supply and your Wells to make sure hotspots have not migrated. When they do, right click
the closest Well and choose &quot;Relocate,&quot; which will allow you to rebuild that
well in the new location. 
<p>All buildings may be moved in this fashion, but it does cost
more Transium than a normal build operation.</p>
