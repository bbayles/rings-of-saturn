<p>Healing is done in the Nerve Center paddock, using MedKits (or Regenerators), and doc
Rovers (ERT and Triage). The camp owner and any of his/her Rovers heal within the Nerve
Center paddock (or inside Nerve Center) as long as there is Transium flowing.

<tr>

<p>Medkits and Regenerators are Gear items that must be built in the Gear Factor, and these work on any
Rover, Building, or avatar, regardless of corporation. The ERT and Triage Rovers will heal
any allied unit simply by being next to them, but this also requires Transium.</p>
