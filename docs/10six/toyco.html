<p>Shenji Watanabe wins the 39<sup>th</sup> annual Robot Sumo Contest, beating several
factory-sponsored competitors. Honda offers Watanabe a private, no-strings grant to

<p>Watanabe sets up a small workshop to produce Rovers with commercial applications ---
assistants for disabled people, guard units, emergency drones, and toys. The small shop

line, in order to make the small robots more durable and to give them a less boxy, sleeker
appearance.</p>
