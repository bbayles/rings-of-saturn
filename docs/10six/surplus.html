<p>After playing for awhile, you may fill up your construction facility inventories. To
accommodate extra Jitters, you can either build extra construction facilities or you may
build a warehouse, which is capable of storing any Jitter, from your corp or another's,
and built items. You may also teleport back to the Common Area and store extra Jitters
there, where anyone from your corporation may use them. This provides a security fallback
for anyone from your corporation whose camp may be raided or conquered.
<p>Soon you will be able to sell back jitters to the Corporate market.</p>
