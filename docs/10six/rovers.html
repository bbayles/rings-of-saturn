<p>Build a Rover Yard and stow your Rover Jitters (these are tank or vehicles). 
Now build a Rover just like weapons and armor. The Rover will appear in the paddock.
Make sure you are not in fire mode and click on the Rover. This will highlight it.
Clicking on the playfield will give that Rover basic movement commands.
<P>Right-clicking will show you a more detailed list of commands commands. Some commands (such as Patrol) can be used in conjunction with the CTRL Key for added features.

<p>Rovers do not start with guns or any other equiptment. To equip a Rover, simply build a weapon or armor and then direct the Rover to that building's paddock by selecting the Rover and then clicking on the building. The Rover will move into the paddock and automatically equip the item there. 
<p>If you are holding a gun or peice of equiptment you wish to deploy on a rover, simply approach the rover and drag-and-drop the item onto the rover.

<p>You can also equip rovers by double clicking on the desired built item. You will then be told that the object is 'Ready to Deploy'. Your cursor will change, and then click on a Rover to equip that weapon. Note that you must be close to the target you are trying to equip.</P>

<td width="38%">
<p>Remember that you must remove old weapons, armor, and modifiers should be removed before placing new ones. This can be done by Jettisoning (dropping), Dismantling (turns object back into a Jitter), or dragging the object off the rover.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">Note that weapons and Rovers have &quot;Attack Classes&quot; and
these must be consistent. Beam Rovers use Beam weapons; Beam weapons may not be built onto
Ballistic Rovers. The three Attack Classes are Beam, Ballistic, and Flame. A few Rovers
are like the avatar, who can use all weapons.</font></p>
