<p>To teleport, go into the Nerve Center, click World View, and zoom down to the
lowest level. Here you can browse the other camps in your Quadrant and determine which
camps are open for teleporting. Then click on a target camp and click &quot;Teleport
Info&quot; which will give you your current bulk and cost in Transium to perform.</P>

<p>If you want to take Rovers with you, they must be in your Nerve Center paddock, in which case they will appear below the teleport cost and their bulk will be added to the cost. Click &quot;Teleport&quot; to commence.</P>
<p> Remember, the first time you teleport, you will cancel your Newbie Defenses.  From this point on, you will be vunerable to attack.</p>
