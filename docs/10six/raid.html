<p>If you've teleported into an enemy corporation's camp, remember, your Rovers use your backpack Transium on raids, so you may want to fill a Mule or a Leech Rover up with Transium and bring them along, too, as they can also transmit Transium to you and to other Rovers. Be sure to watch your health and tansium levels.  When they run low, its time to get out.</p>
