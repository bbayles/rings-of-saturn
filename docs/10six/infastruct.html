<p>Carl Meine establishes a small company in Hannover, Germany called Neuhaus, which
specializes in prefabricated construction components, siding, and polymer materials.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2024</b></i></p>

<p>Neuhaus structures used extensively to provide temporary shelters for the citizens of
Konstanz in southern Germany after unusually heavy rains caused the flood of the Bodensee.
Neuhaus also wins several contracts to repair and replace many of the ruined buildings and
homes throughout the city.</p>

<p>Moved by the flood experience, Meine begins designing fluoropolymer fabrics in the
hopes that they could assist in flood prevention.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2025</b></i></p>

<p>Severe El Nino related flooding staved off in Obregon, Mexico. Using Meine&#146;s
experimental polymer sheeting, the Yagui River was held to its banks past the city, the
airport, and the commercial Port of Guaymas. Total materials cost of $30,000 for the
sheeting estimated to have prevented at least $200 million in damage.</p>

<p>Fluoropolymer sheeting patent filed under the name PolyStruct.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2026</b></i></p>

<p>Emergency service organizations around the world commission customized PolyStruct
materials for areas troubled by floods and mudslides.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2027</b></i></p>

<p>New PolyStruct plants built in Mexico City and Taiwan. PolyStruct finds other
applications in commercial structures and as translucent, waterproof, UV-filtering tenting
for large open areas, such as stadiums, malls, and open-air plazas.</p>

<p>Neuhaus launches a Development and Future Products division under the name InfraStruct.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2028</b></i></p>

<p>Conventional building materials researchers added to the InfraStruct Development group.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2029</b></i></p>

<p>InfraStruct division announces a transparent form of PolyStruct with the strength of
aluminum but ten times the flexibility.</p>

<p>Neuhaus creates a business development plan to create sun-safe outdoor areas --- parks,
beaches, and sporting areas under tents of transparent PolyStruct to keep out rain and UV
radiation.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2032</b></i></p>

<p>Neuhaus officially changes its corporate identity to InfraStruct and adopts the new
logo.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2036</b></i></p>

<p>Partner research with OneWorld leads to the creation of a passive polymer air filter
that is low cost enough to be used at residential pollution points such as chimneys and
stove vents. Estimated reduction of up to 10% of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and
particulate carbons if employed across an industrialized area.</p>

<p>PolyStruct medical applications announced, which include room filtration sheets for
asthmatics, allergy sufferers, and patients with other respiratory ailments.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2039</b></i></p>

<p>InfraStruct becomes a charter member of the United Nations new Global Economic Council.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2045</b></i></p>

<p>Commercial release of InfraSeal, a bitumen fluoropolymer developed to prevent erosion
and deterioration on historic structures. The transparent sealant acts as a breathable but
fire resistant, water resistant, UV reflective shell that improves durability and tensile
strength of simple materials such as stone and wood.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2052</b></i></p>

<p>Carl Meine appoints Ulrich Spieler to replace him as President and CEO of InfraStruct.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2055</b></i></p>

<p>InfraStruct develops inexpensive metal infused polymers as barricades for United
Nations peacekeeping forces. These barricade walls are deployed in the border conflict
between Ethiopia and Sudan and were used to create defendable corridors that would also
shield refugee migrations. Because they could be cheaply and quickly replaced, the
barricades were simply too costly to be repeatedly assaulted.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2057</b></i></p>

<p>InfraStruct creates a line of interlocking prefabricated fortification components for
UN peacekeepers and Red Cross units. These fortified areas could be quickly constructed to
provide protection around a base camp, staging area, or mobile hospital.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2059</b></i></p>

<p>Despite criticism from the United Nations General Assembly, InfraStruct makes its
fortification components commercially available.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2065</b></i></p>

<p>InfraStruct forms a partnership with Huber Arms to integrate stationary defensive
weapon systems into turret structures that can be integrated into its basic fortification
components.</p>

<p>Carl Meine sells all of his shares of InfraStruct stock and resigns his position on the
Board of Directors.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2070</b></i></p>

<p>InfraStruct launches two flyby satellites to collect independent data on the planetoid
Visitor.</p>
<i><b>

<p>2073</b></i></p>

<p>InfraStruct agrees to help fund and provide construction materials for the structures
that will need to be built during the exploration of Visitor</font>.</p>
