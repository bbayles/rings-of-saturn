<p>Here you may create groups, accept invitations to join groups, and invite
others to join your group. Groups are only formed with members of the same corpororation.
You can also form unique groups, called cadres, which have special rankings and stature on
Visitor. You can also invite others to join your Mutual Defense Network. You establish MDN
relationships with other players, pledging to come to each other's aid. If you have an
MDN, you can then use the Alert MDN button (red one next to teleport back), which sends an
automatic message to any MDN members online.</p>
