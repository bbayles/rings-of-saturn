the WSL and its stadiums.</p>

<p><em><strong>2050</strong></em></p>

<p>Emil and Anna successfully lobby the WSL to include a series of competitions in
&quot;extreme&quot; sports categories.</p>

<p>Richard Perez dies. Anna and Emil are appointed as joint chief executives of the
company.</p>

<p><em><strong>2053</strong></em></p>

contexts.</p>

<p><em><strong>2060</strong></em></p>

<p>Company image restructured to reflect the character of its leadership. The current
&quot;eXtreme&quot; name and logo are approved.</p>

<p>Partnerships announced with several VidNet broadcast services, as well as worldwide
music publishers. The media gets familiar with eXtreme.</p>

<p>eXtreme reaches the $100 billion yearly earnings mark.</p>

employs cybernetic jerseys and a virtual playfield.</p>

<p><em><strong>2066</strong></em></p>

<p>The World Sporting League turns down the petitions to have Virtual Combat and Virtual
Termina introduced as exhibition competitions despite the Perez&#146; personal backing.
eXtreme terminates the Brute Force consulting contract and pulls Virtual Combat in house.
All support of and investment in the WSL is pulled, and eXtreme announces its own
international competition series, Adrenaline, consisting entirely of unique extreme
sports.</p>

<p><em><strong>2067</strong></em></p>

<p>Brute Force loses its suit for partial interest and profit of Virtual Combat. eXtreme
cancels advertising contracts and sells all of its stock in Brute Force and its
subsidiaries.</p>

independent investigators, but no culprit determined.</p>

was cast by GEC member Brute Force.</p>

at the planetoid Visitor.</p>

<p>eXtreme accepts the invitation to fill the open slot on the council.</p>

<p>Zgrav becomes part of the Adrenaline competition.</p>

<p>Explosion on Zgrav station Olympia causes a hull breach that kills 9 Zgrav players,
including eXtreme co-president Emil Perez. Anna Perez narrowly escapes the same fate by
luckily snagging her tether on a goal support. UN special investigators cannot find
conclusive evidence to determine whether the explosion resulted from a malfunctioning
stabilizing thruster or whether the device was sabotaged.</p>

<p>Anna Perez announces that her brother&#146;s spirit will always remain within the
company.</p>

<p><em><strong>2073</strong></em></p>
